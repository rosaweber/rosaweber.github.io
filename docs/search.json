    "text": "About me\nI am an Assistant Professor and Postdoctoral researcher in sociology at Stockholm University and the French Institute for Demographic Studies. Previously, I conduced an international postdoc project (funded by the Swedish Research Council for Health, Working Life and Welfare). My research interests lie in international migration, social stratification, and residential stratification.\nMy ongoing research focuses on international migration and integration in Sweden and France. I am currently engaged in empirical work assessing how neighborhood and school segregation shape the friendship circles and socioeconomic outcomes of immigrants and their descendants. I also study migration behavior and assess prevalent factors that impact individual propensities to migrate and return migrate. I analyze both administrative and survey data, including linked Finnish and Swedish register data and Trajectories and Origins 2 (TeO2). I use a variety of quantitative methods, among others difference in differences models, event history analysis and fixed effects models.\nMy work has appeared in the European Journal of Population, Research in Social Stratification and Mobility, Population, Space and Place, PLOS ONE, and Population Research and Policy Review, among other outlets.\n\n\nEducation\nPhD in Sociology, 2020\nStockholm University\nM.Sc. in Sociology(Research), 2014\nLondon School of Economics\nB.A. in Serbian/Croatian and Eastern European Studies, 2013\nUniversity College London"
