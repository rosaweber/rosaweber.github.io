### About me

I am Assistant Professor in sociology at Stockholm University and Principal Investigator of the *Segregation across Multiple Domains* project (awarded by the Swedish Research Council for Health, Working Life and Welfare, 4.8m SEK in October 2023), which assesses workplace and neighbourhood segregation using Swedish register data. Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the French Institute for Demographic Studies within the 3GEN project (PI Mathieu Ichou) and conducted an international postdoc project (awarded by the Swedish Research Council for Health, Working Life and Welfare, 2.4m SEK in May 2021). My research interests lie in social stratification, ethnic inequalities, and international migration.

My ongoing research focuses on migration, integration, and social inequalities in Sweden, Finland, and France. I am currently engaged in empirical work assessing how neighborhood, workplace, and school segregation shape the socioeconomic trajectories of immigrants and their descendants. I also assess gender differences in the labor market, with a focus on child related career costs for women in STEM fields. I further study migration behavior and assess individual propensities to migrate and return migrate. I analyze both administrative and survey data, including linked Finnish and Swedish register data and Trajectories and Origins 2 (TeO2). I use a variety of quantitative methods, among others difference in differences models, event history analysis, and fixed effects models.

My work has appeared in *Demography*, *Research in Social Stratification and Mobility*, *European Journal of Population*, *Population Research and Policy Review*, and *PLOS ONE*, among other outlets.
